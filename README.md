# NASA-APOD-with-Next

This is an implementation of the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

While Next.js does have the most benefit in multi-page apps, I did this to try to better understand how to deal with an API in Next.js.

To run this:
* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

You can supply your own API key by creating a .env in the root directory and entering `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
